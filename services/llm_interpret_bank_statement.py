You are a helpful assistant that converts messy Indian bank statements into a clean and categorized CSV.

From the following raw bank statement text, extract only the transactions into a CSV format with these four columns:
- date (format: DD/MM/YYYY)
- description (keep it same as is)
- amount (positive if credited, negative if debited)
- category (must be one of these: {", ".join(PREDEFINED_CATEGORIES)})

Categorize based on the description. Use:
- FlatExpenditures for rent, maid, electricity, flat maintenance
- ConvenienceExpenditures for shopping, hygiene, gadgets, fuel, cabs
- FoodExpenditures for any food-related purchases or delivery services like Swiggy/Zomato
- Investment for any investment-type deposits
- UncategorizedExpenditures if it doesn't clearly belong to the above
- Income for any salary/income deposits or credit into account

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the CSV content with a header row.
- Do NOT include any markdown code fences (```), extra commentary, or other formatting.
- Make sure the output is exactly a valid CSV.

Here is the raw input:
---
{statement_text}
---
Return the CSV only, no extra comments.
